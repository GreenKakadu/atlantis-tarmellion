1. I need something to only allow certain weapons for assassination. It
could be something like the thing for armors
(ArmorType::USEINASSASSINATE).

2. I want to change the way healing works right now. Currently you
either use a healing potion or herbs and someone with healing skill. The
healing potion stuff is fine, but it would be nice to have other things
with healing possibility too. Maybe having a flag in item definition to
say that it works like a healing potion. But the main thing is healing
with the healing skill. Currently your success chance and the number of
injured people healed is determined only by the skill level of healing
and a herb is used. I want to determine the number of injured people by
the healing skill as before, but the chance of success should be
determined by the item used for healing. Consequently there should be
more items with healing power. In Tarmellion we have herbs, fungus,
medicine plant and maybe healing draft and medicine for this use. I want
to have larger chances if a more advanced item is used. Do you think
that is possible?
