<h2>Darkman Kingdom</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>The Kingdom of Veldia is part of the great Hollowsphere called underworld. Its ten earldoms are rich and fertile grottoes in a common cavern. The capital city Char'ar'ton is built right into the stalagmites and stalagtites of the centre of this cavern.
<p>Government:
<br>High King Durstin XXIV. is very ambitious. He plans to claim as much of the underworld as he can to show the surface human leaders that he is more successful than they. He will need help with this undertaking, so perhaps someone can be found to lead an expedition into the uncharted regions and claim them for Durstin. 
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Everybody is welcome in Veldia, as long as they bow down to High King Durstin XXIV.. He is willing to cooperate with almost everyone to fulfill his dream.
