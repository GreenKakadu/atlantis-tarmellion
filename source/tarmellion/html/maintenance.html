<h2>Maintenance</h2>

<p>I am not sure if it is really new, but as food instead of silver to "pay" for the maintenance of units is very important in Tarmellion, here is the way the engine handles things.
<br>A unit will cover its maintenance costs according to the following sequence. It will:
<ol>

<li>try to eat food held by the unit, if unit has CONSUME UNIT or CONSUME FACTION flag
</li>
<li>try to eat food items held by any other units of the same faction, if unit has CONSUME FACTION flag
</li>
<li>try to eat silver held by the unit
</li>
<li>try to eat silver held by any other units of the same faction
</li>
<li>try to eat food held by the unit
</li>
<li>try to eat food items held by any other units of the same faction
</li>
<li>try to eat unclaimed silver
</li>
<li>try to eat silver held by any allied units
</li>
<li>try to eat food held by any allied units
</li>
</ol>

<p>Which kind of food item is consumed by a unit is determined by the following preference list:
<br>delicatessen sooner than 
<br>food 
<br>rations 
<br>meat 
<br>fish 
<br>grain 
<br>mushrooms 
<br>sheep 
<br>wollinger 
<br>lizards 
<br>pointy eared sheep 
<br>livestock 
<br>eggs 
<br>mussels 
<br>truffles 
<br>grapes
