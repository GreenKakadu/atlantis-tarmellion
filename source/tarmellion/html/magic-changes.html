<h2>Magic Changes</h2>

<p>Magic is one part of the game that was reworked thoroughly in Tarmellion as it was always the single most powerful choice in atlantis games. I have tried to balance it to the other choices war and trade while still keeping it interesting for magic interested players. The following things were done to the Magic:

<ol>
<li>
<b>More Magic Users per Faction Point</b>
<table border=1>
<tr><td>Faction Points</td><td>mages</td></tr>
<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>6</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>14</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>24</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>36</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>60</td></tr>
</table>
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Limited Magic Users</b>
<p>Only heroes (the starting characters of which each faction may have only one) are able to study all the magic paths and perfect them up to skill level 5.
<br>Each race has a racial leader that can study 6 magic skills (LHUMA and LHOBG only 4) which allow them to perfect about two magical uses. These leaders can study up to skill level 3. 
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Spell Failure</b>
<p>One of the changes done to the code is that every spell may now fail. This spell failure is listed with each spell description ingame. The caster will get a message that his spell has failed. The spell effect simply does not appear may this be the fire ball in a single round of battle or the magic sword after a month of labour.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Multiple Mage Units</b>
<p>To make studying for the vast amount of mages available in Tarmellion easier, they can be grouped together into unit of more than one mage. A magic-user is giveable in Tarmellion.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>New Magic Paths</b>
<p>The structure of the magic skill dependancy has been changed. This is best seen on the page <a href=magic-paths.html>Magic Paths</a> elsewhere on this homepage.
<br>
</li>

<li>summon wyrm - a spell to summon evil wyrms to do the casters bidding</li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Modified Magic Spells</b>
<p>Many of the known spells were modified to balance them in the new structure. I will not list the exact modifications here as they are given in the spell descriptions ingame. Just a few notes about the biggest changes:
<br>dragon lore - is now a mere foundation skill for summon dragon
<br>summon balrog - can summon only one balrog which is not giveable
<br>create something - will probably have different output amounts than before as they were reworked and balanced
<br>wolf lore - is no longer dependant on the terrain and allows to summon either wolves or ice wolves depending on the skill level and the syntax of the3 cast command
<br>
