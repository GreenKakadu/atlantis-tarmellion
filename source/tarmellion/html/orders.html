                  Order Summary
                </H2>
                <P>
                  To specify a [unit], use the unit number.  If specifying a
                  unit that will be created this turn, use the form "NEW #" if
                  the unit belongs to your faction, or "FACTION # NEW #" if
                  the unit belongs to a different faction.  See the <A
                  HREF="#form">FORM</A> order for a more complete description.
                   [faction] means that a faction number is required; [object]
                  means that an object number (generally the number of a
                  building or ship) is required. [item] means an item (like
                  wood or longbow) that a unit can have in its possession.
                  [flag] is an argument taken by several orders, that sets or
                  unsets a flag for a unit. A [flag] value must be either 1
                  (set the flag) or 0 (unset the flag).  Other parameters are
                  generally numbers or names.
                
                <P>
                  IMPORTANT: Remember that names containing spaces (e.g.,
                  "Plate Armor"), must be surrounded by double quotes, or the
                  spaces must be replaced with underscores "_" (e.g.,
                  Plate_Armor).
                
                <P>
                  Also remember that anything used in an example is just that,
                  an example and makes no gaurentee that such an item,
                  structure, or skill actually exists within the game.

                  This is the same as the <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order,

                  In order, move north, then enter structure number 1, move
                  through an inner route, and finally move southeast. Will
                  attack any units that forbid access to any of these

                  This command allows you to set a list of preferred armor for
                  a unit.  After searching for armor on the preferred list,
                  the standard armor precedence takes effect if an armor
                  hasn't been set.  The second form clears the preferred armor
                  list.

                  Attempt to assassinate the specified unit, or one of the
                  unit's people if the unit contains more than one person. 
                  The order may only be issued by a one-man unit.
                
                <P>
                  A unit may only attempt to assassinate a unit which is able

                <P>
                  Attack a target unit.  If multiple ATTACK orders are given,
                  all of the targets will be attacked.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  To attack units 17, 431, and 985:
                
                <PRE>ATTACK 17
ATTACK 431 985

                  AUTOTAX [flag]
                </H4>
                <P>
                  AUTOTAX 1 causes the unit to attempt to tax every turn
                  (without requiring the TAX order) until the flag is unset.
                  AUTOTAX 0 unsets the flag.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  To cause the unit to attempt to tax every turn.

                  AVOID [flag]
                </H4>
                <P>
                  AVOID 1 instructs the unit to avoid combat wherever
                  possible. The unit will not enter combat unless it issues an
                  ATTACK order, or the unit's faction is attacked in the
                  unit's hex. AVOID 0 cancels this.
                
                <P>
                  The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive;
                  setting one automatically cancels the other.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  Set the unit to avoid combat when possible.

                  BEHIND [flag]
                </H4>
                <P>
                  BEHIND 1 sets the unit to be behind other units in combat. 
                  BEHIND 0 cancels this.
                
                <P>
                  Example:

                  BUILD given with no parameters causes the unit to perform
                  work on the object that it is currently inside.  BUILD given
                  with an [object type] (such as "Tower" or "Galleon")
                  instructs the unit to begin work on a new object of the type
                  given. The final form instructs the unit to enter the same
                  building as [unit] and to assist in building that structure,
                  even if it is a structure which was begun that same turn. 
                  This help will be rejected if the unit you are helping does
                  not consider you to be friendly.

                  town marketplace, or to buy new people in any region where
                  people are available for recruiting.  If the unit can't
                  afford as many as [quantity], it will attempt to buy as many
                  as it can. If the demand for the item (from all units in the
                  region) is greater than the number available, the available
                  items will be split among the buyers in proportion to the
                  amount each buyer attempted to buy. When buying people,
                  specify the race of the people as the [item]. If the second
                  form is specified, the unit will attempt to buy as many as
                  it can afford.

                  The CONSUME order instructs the unit to use food items in
                  preference to silver for maintenance costs. CONSUME UNIT
                  tells the unit to use food items that are in that unit's
                  possession before using silver. CONSUME FACTION tells the
                  unit to use any food items that the faction owns (in the
                  same region as the unit) before using silver. CONSUME tells
                  the unit to use silver before food items (this is the
                  default).

                  This order allows any two units that can see each other, to

                  by the two units must be complementary.  If either unit
                  involved does not have the items it is offering, or if the
                  exchange orders given are not complementary, the exchange is
                  aborted.  Men may not be exchanged.

                <P>
                  Attempt to change your faction's type.  In the order, you
                  can specify up to three faction types (WAR, TRADE, and
                  MAGIC) and the number of faction points to assign to each
                  type; if you are assigning points to only one or two types,
                  you may omit the types that will not have any points.
                
                <P>
                  Changing the number of faction points assigned to MAGIC may
                  be tricky. Increasing the MAGIC points will always succeed,
                  but if you decrease the number of points assigned to MAGIC,
                  you must make sure that you have only the number of
                  magic-skilled leaders allowed by the new number of MAGIC
                  points BEFORE you change your point distribution. For
                  example, if you have 3 mages (3 points assigned to MAGIC),
                  but want to use one of those points for WAR or TRADE (change
                  to MAGIC 2), you must first get rid of one of your mages by

                  either giving it to another faction or ordering it to <A
                  HREF="#forget">FORGET</A> all its magic skills. If you have
                  too many mages for the number of points you try to assign to
                  MAGIC, the FACTION order will fail.
                
                <P>

                <P>
                  Form a new unit.  The newly created unit will be in your
                  faction, in the same region as the unit which formed it, and
                  in the same structure if any.  It will start off, however,
                  with no people or items; you should, in the same month,
                  issue orders to transfer people into the new unit, or have
                  it recruit members. The new unit will inherit its flags from
                  the unit that forms it, such as avoiding, behind, and
                  autotax.
                
                <P>
                  The FORM order is followed by a list of orders for the newly

                  The purpose of the "alias" parameter is so that you can

                  number until you receive the next turn report.  To refer to
                  the new unit in this set of orders, pick an alias number
                  (the only restriction on this is that it must be at least 1,
                  and you should not create two units in the same region in
                  the same month, with the same alias numbers).  The new unit
                  can then be referred to as NEW <alias> in place of the
                  regular unit number.
                
                <P>
                  You can refer to newly created units belonging to other
                  factions, if you know what alias number they are, e.g.
                  FACTION 15 NEW 2 will refer to faction 15's newly created
                  unit with alias 2.
                
                <P>
                  Note: If a unit moves out of the region in which it was
                  formed (by the <A HREF="#move">MOVE</A> order, or
                  otherwise), the alias will no longer work. This is to
                  prevent conflicts with other units that may have the same
                  alias in other regions.
                
                <P>
                  If the demand for recruits in that region that month is much
                  higher than the supply, it may happen that the new unit does
                  not gain all the recruits you ordered it to buy, or it may
                  not gain any recruits at all.  If the new units gains at
                  least one recruit, the unit will form possessing any unused
                  silver and all the other items it was given.  If no recruits
                  are gained at all, the empty unit will be dissolved, and the
                  silver and any other items it was given will revert to the
                  first unit you have in that region.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  This set of orders for unit 17 would create two new units
                  with alias numbers 1 and 2, name them Merlin's Guards and
                  Merlin's Workers, set the description for Merlin's Workers,
                  have both units recruit men, and have Merlin's Guards study
                  combat.  Merlin's Workers will have the default order <A
                  HREF="#work">WORK</A>, as all newly created units do. The
                  unit that created these two then pays them enough money
                  (using the NEW keyword to refer to them by alias numbers) to
                  cover the costs of recruitment and the month's maintenance.

                  The first form of the GIVE order gives a quantity of an item
                  to another unit. The second form of the GIVE order will give
                  all of a given item to another unit.  The third form will
                  give all of an item except for a specific quantity to
                  another unit.  The fourth form will give all items of a
                  specific type to another unit.  The final form of the GIVE
                  order gives the entire unit to the specified unit's faction.
                
                <P>
                  The classes of items which are exceptable for the fourth
                  form of this order are, NORMAL, ADVANCED, TRADE, MAN or MEN,
                  MONSTER or MONSTERS, MAGIC, WEAPON OR WEAPONS, ARMOR, MOUNT
                  or MOUNTS, BATTLE, SPECIAL, TOOL or TOOLS, FOOD, and ITEM or
                  ITEMS (which is the combination of all of the previous
                  categories).
                
                <P>
                  A unit may only give items, including silver, to a unit
                  which it is able to see, unless the faction of the target
                  unit has declared you Friendly or better.  If the target
                  unit is not a member of your faction, then its faction must
                  have declared you Friendly, with a couple of exceptions.
                  First, silver may be given to any unit, regardless of
                  factional affiliation. Secondly, men may not be given to
                  units in other factions (you must give the entire unit); the
                  reason for this is to prevent highly skilled units from
                  being sabotaged with a <A HREF="#give">GIVE</A> order.
                
                <P>
                  There are also a few restrictions on orders given by units
                  who been given to another faction. If the receiving faction
                  is not allied to the giving faction, the unit may not issue
                  the <A HREF="#advance">ADVANCE</A> order, or issue any more
                  <A HREF="#give">GIVE</A> orders.  Both of these rules are to
                  prevent unfair sabotage tactics.
                
                <P>
                  If 0 is specified as the unit number, then the items are
                  discarded.
                
                <P>

                  GUARD [flag]
                </H4>
                <P>
                  GUARD 1 sets the unit issuing the order to prevent
                  non-Friendly units from collecting taxes in the region, and
                  to prevent any units not your own from pillaging the region.
                   Guarding units will also attempt to prevent Unfriendly
                  units from entering the region.  GUARD 0 cancels Guard
                  status.
                
                <P>
                  The Guard and Avoid Combat flags are mutually exclusive;
                  setting one automatically cancels the other.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  Instruct the current unit to be on guard.

                  HOLD [flag]
                </H4>
                <P>
                  HOLD 1 instructs the issuing unit to never join a battle in
                  regions the unit is not in.  This can be useful if the unit
                  is in a building, and doesn't want to leave the building to
                  join combat. HOLD 0 cancels holding status.
                
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  Instruct the unit to avoid combat in other regions.

                  IDLE
                </H4>
                <P>
                IDLE allows units to do nothing for one month, thus preventing units from "stealing" work income from their hosts or getting error messages in hexes without work income.
                <P>
                  Example:
                
                <P>
                  Instruct the unit to avoid working in this region.

                <P>
                  Leave the object you are currently in. If a unit is capable
                  of swimming or flying then this order is usable to leave a
                  boat while at sea.

                <P>
                  Attempt to move in the direction(s) specified.  If more than
                  one direction is given, the unit will move multiple times,
                  in the order specified by the MOVE order, until no more
                  directions are given, or until one of the moves fails.  A
                  move can fail because the units runs out of movement points,
                  because the unit attempts to move into the ocean, or because
                  the units attempts to enter a structure, and is rejected.
                
                <P>
                  Valid directions are:
                
                <P>
                  1) The compass directions North, Northwest, Southwest,
                  South, Southeast, and Northeast.  These can be abbreviated
                  N, NW, SW, S, SE, NE.
                
                <P>
                  2) A structure number.
                
                <P>
                  3) OUT, which will leave the structure that the unit is in.
                
                <P>
                  4) IN, which will move through an inner passage in the
                  structure that the unit is currently in.
                
                <P>
                  Multiple MOVE orders given by one unit will chain together.
                
                <P>
                  Note that MOVE orders can lead to combat, due to hostile
                  units meeting, or due to an advancing unit being forbidden
                  access to a region.  In this case, combat occurs each time
                  all movement out of a single region occurs.
                
                <P>
                  Example 1: Units 1 and 2 are in Region A, and unit 3 is in
                  Region B.  Units 1 and 2 are hostile to unit 3.  Both unit 1
                  and 2 move into region B, and attack unit 3.  Since both
                  units moved out of the same region, they attack unit 3 at
                  the same time, and the battle is between units 1 and 2, and
                  unit 3.
                
                <P>
                  Example 2: Same as example 1, except unit 2 is in Region C,
                  instead of region A.  Both units move into Region B, and
                  attack unit 3.  Since unit 1 and unit 2 moved out of
                  different regions, their battles occur at different times. 
                  Thus, unit 1 attacks unit 3 first, and then unit 2 attacks
                  unit 3 (assuming unit 3 survives the first attack).  Note
                  that the order of battles could have happened either way.

                  Names can be of any length, up to the line length your

                <P>
                  In order to rename a settlement (city, town or village), the
                  unit attempting to rename it must be the owner of a large
                  enough structure located in the city. It requires a tower or
                  better to rename a village, a fort or better to rename a
                  town and a castle or mystic fortress to rename a city. It
                  also costs $10 to rename a village, $20 to rename a town,

                <P>
                  NOAID 1 indicates that if the unit attacks, or is attacked,
                  it is not to be aided by units in other hexes. NOAID status
                  is very useful for scouts or probing units, who do not wish
                  to drag their nearby armies into battle if they are caught.
                  NOAID 0 cancels this.
                
                <P>
                  If multiple units are on one side in a battle, they must all
                  have the NOAID flag on, or they will receive aid from other
                  hexes.
                
                <P>
                  Example:

                  Set a unit to receive no aid in battle.

                <P>
                  NOCROSS 1 indicates that if a unit attempts to cross a body
                  of water then that unit should instead not cross it,
                  regardless of whether the unit otherwise could do so. Units
                  inside of a ship are not affected by this flag (IE, they are
                  able to sail within the ship). This flag is useful to
                  prevent scouts from accidentally drowning when exploring in
                  games where movement over water is allowed. NOCROSS 0
                  cancels this.

                  The OPTION order is used to toggle various settings that
                  affect your reports, and other email details. OPTION TIMES
                  sets it so that your faction receives the times each week
                  (this is the default); OPTION NOTIMES sets it so that your
                  faction is not sent the times.
                
                <P>
                  The OPTION TEMPLATE order toggles the length of the Orders
                  Template that appears at the bottom of a turn report.  The
                  OFF setting eliminates the Template altogether, and the
                  SHORT, LONG and MAP settings control how much detail the
                  Template contains. The MAP setting will produce an ascii map
                  of the region and surrounding regions in addition other
                  details.

                <P>
                  The PASSWORD order is used to set your faction's password.
                  If you have a password set, you must specify it on your
                  #ATLANTIS line for the game to accept your orders.  This
                  protects you orders from being overwritten, either by
                  accident or intentionally by other players.  PASSWORD with
                  no password given clears out your faction's password.
                
                <P>
                  IMPORTANT: The PASSWORD order does not take effect until the
                  turn is actually run.  So if you set your password, and then
                  want to re-submit orders, you should use the old password
                  until the turn has been run.

                  This command allows a mage or apprentice to prepare a battle
                  item (e.g. a Staff of Fire) for use in battle. This allows

                  get a separate turn report for the new faction). Note that
                  you must give your password for this order to work, to

                  The SPOILS order allows you to limit the spoils you should
                  take after a battle.  The valid values for type are 'NONE',
                  'WALK', 'RIDE', 'FLY', or 'ALL'. The second form is
                  equivalent to 'SPOILS ALL'.

                <P>
                  When level NONE is specified, only spoils with 0 weight will
                  be picked up. SPOILS ALL will allow a unit to collect any
                  spoils which are dropped regardless of weight or capacity.
                  SPOILS follwed by a movement mode will allow a unit to
                  collect any spoils while the spoils don't prevent the unit
                  to move using the specified movement mode.

                  The TURN order may be used to delay orders by one (or more)
                  turns. By making the TURN order repeating (via '@'), orders
                  inside the TURN/ENDTURN construct will repeat.  Multiple
                  TURN orders in a row will execute on successive turns, and
                  if they all repeat, they will form a loop of orders.  Each
                  TURN section must be ended by an ENDTURN line.

                <P>
                  This command allows you to set a list of preferred weapons
                  for a unit.  After searching for weapons on the preferred
                  list, the standard weapon precedence takes effect if a
                  weapon hasn't been set.  The second form clears the
                  preferred weapon list.

                  Use unclaimed funds to aquire basic items that you need. If
                  you do not have sufficient unclaimed, or if you try withdraw
                  any other than a basic item, an error will be given.
                  Withdraw can NOT be used in the Nexus (to prevent building
                  towers and such there).  The first form is the same as
