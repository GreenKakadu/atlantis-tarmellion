<h3>Tunnels of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-tunnel.jpg align=right>The tunnels of Tarmellion link the different parts of the Hollowspheres together. Noone lives here.
<p>Well not really noone, just noone sane. Crawlers, the scavengers of the Hollowsphere, tunnelworms, the creatures rumored to be responsible for the creation of the tunnels themselves and wicked kobolds do live here. Some of the tunnels end surprisingly in front of a demon pit, the lair of the mindeating illyrthil or an innocent cave with hardly any bones in front.
<p>But there is more to tunnels than simply a way of getting from one place to another. There may be deposits of iron, rough gems, mithril, admantium and gold. Naturally stone, rootstone and sometimes corestone can be quarried here. Giant lizards and sometimes even giant spiders roam around in tunnels and can be caught and trained. The giant bat and the giant mole are native to tunnels.
