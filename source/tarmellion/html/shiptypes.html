<A NAME="tepuke">
<h4>Tepuke</h4></a>

<A NAME="longboat">
<h4>Longboat</h4></a>
<p>The typical vessel of the vikings. The simple ship is surprisingly fast. It has a single sail on its single mast and can be rowed to increase speed or move against the wind. Traditionally a carving of a dragons head proudly sits on bow and stern.

<A NAME="sloop">
<h4>Sloop</h4></a>
<p>Sloops are usually small, single masted craft, carrying a huge spread of sail in proportion to their size. This makes them fast and manoeuvrable, and their shallow draft and fast lines simply look good. Their sail arrangement is normally a fore-and-aft rig, with a mainsail and a single foresail. 

<A NAME="cutter">
<h4>Cutter</h4></a>
<p>The cutter is a fast small single masted vessel with a fore-and-aft mainsail, a foresail and a jib. It also frequently carries a square-rigged topsail.

<A NAME="schooner">
<h4>Schooner</h4></a>
<p>Schooners are small two masted ships carrying fore and aft sails on both masts. Their narrow hulls and large spread of sail makes them fast, capable of exceeding 11 knots in the right conditions. They also have a shallow draft. Because of their sturdy build and high speed they are valued as warships.
