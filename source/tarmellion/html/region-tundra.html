<h3>Tundras of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-tundra.jpg align=right>The tundras of Tarmellion lightly populated by barbarians and gnolls.
<p>They are home to the ice wolf, the polar bear and the yeti. In the solitude of this cold area necromancers guilds, cloud palaces, ice caves and lairs of white dragons can be found and their inhabitants may find you.
<p>A bit of grain is growing here, some sheep and cattle eke out a living. Where the ground is tainted red small deposits of iron ore can be found and the many streams are littered with gold nuggets. The light woods offer wood, ironwood and sometimes even yew. Although seemingly insignificant the plant life of this area is rich in herbs, fungus and medicine plants. Large herds of caribous and other nordic animals provide the hunters of the tundra with meat, furs and pelts in abundance. Giant wolves and hardy ponies are the preferred mounts. But the king of the tundra is the mighty mammoth.
