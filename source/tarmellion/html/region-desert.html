<h3>Deserts of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-desert.jpg align=right>The deserts of Tarmellion are not as lifeless as one might think. Although terribly hot, nomads and sandlings manage to live here. 
<p>As do lions, giant scorpians and renegade sandlings who add to the deadly nature of the deserts. Stumbling upon a giant castle, a ruin, an ancient temple or even a pyramid in this already inhospitable land is probably the beginning of even harder times.
<p>However on the borders of the desert and around oases a bit of grain, some sheep and a few cattle are raised. In the sands at some special places rough gems can be found and even a bit of iron is hidden there. In the rocky parts of the desert quarryable stone, rootstone and sometimes even corestone can be found. But the desert is mainly a country for mounts. Large herds of ponies, horses and camels are looked after by the nomadic inhabitants. Chimeras, griffons and fire drakes and lizards like the hot climate and have settled on the rocky outcrops in the deeper desert.
