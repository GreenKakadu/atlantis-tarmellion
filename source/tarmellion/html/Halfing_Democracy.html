<h2>Halfing Democracy</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>The Shire lies on the shores of the Eastern Sea, its capitol Ashhaim is only a short way inland from the harbour at Helbruk. The Shire consists of a dozen regions of extremely fertile plains with happy and hard-working inhabitants.
<p>Government:
<br>Ashhaim is ruled by the Mayor, a person elected by the population in differing intervals.Although technically only in charge of the city of Ashhaim his decisions are followed by the whole Shire, probably because it is easier than thinkuing up own ways of doing things. The second political power in the Shire are its mages, but as they are all lowlanders with their inbred disdain, they keep to themselves a lot and only lift their voices when their own affairs are concerned.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Ashaim is the trading centre of the continent Ardan, merchants and artificers from all over Tarmellion come here to do business. Maybe the easygoing nature and good living of the Shire people have something to do with the willingness of all traders to do their haggling here.
