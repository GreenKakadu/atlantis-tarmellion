<h2>Duergar Kingdom</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>The Vault is part of the Hollowsphere called underdeeps and in its centre lies the city of Vaulthall. 10 choice grottoes combine to this huge cavern that houses the complete realm of the duergar clan.
<p>Government:
<br>Dregin Blackhammer the king of the duergar has high plans for the underdeeps. Currently he is mustering forces to annex the surrounding areas. 
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Everybody able to hold a weapon or a tool is welcome to help enlarge the kingdom. But some will even try striking out on their own as the underdeep is vast and unchartered.
