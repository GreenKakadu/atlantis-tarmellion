<h3>Oceans of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-ocean.jpg align=right>The oceans of Tarmellion are unchartered and wild. Many a ship that bravely left its harbour to reach distant shores never reached its destination. 
<p>Fearsome monster lurk beneath the surface of its waters: giant squid and merfolk appear from one moment to the other, but also pirates can befound nearly everywhere. On sighting a derelict ship, a whirlpool or a small uninhabited isle you should beware of the dangers likely to descend upon you.
<p>But apart from these dangers, there are riches to be found in these regions. Large schools of fish, rich banks of mussels or even the occasional whale make it worthwhile to brave this wet element.
