<h2>New Features of the game of Tarmellion</h2>
<p>Times rewards:
<p>The handling of times rewards is something that will be handled completely different in Tarmellion.

<p>- First there will be order rewards. Meaning that some scripts done by me will parse through the orders that are send in and reward correct behaviour there. The things rewarded are linked to your profession. So it is worthwhile for a merchant or artificer to produce raw materials and goods, while a warrior should train combat and fight a lot. I think you get the picture.

<p>- Besides that I may check out if the things posted to the times are really put into action in orders and hand out a penalty or reward then.

<p>- Excellent/unsuitable behaviour for the race and/or alignment will also be rewarded/punished.

<p>- And at last the rewards for times messages as known from other games. There will be a feature available on this forum allowing everyone to rate the replies to posts in the Tarmellion Times Forum. On a scale of 0 to 10. I myself will also rate them and a reward based on this rating will then be granted. Thus a single message may get as much as 10 reward points. 

<p>These reward points will get you a reward in unclaimed silver AND the possibility to "buy" nice things via the homepage. In the players list on the homepage will be listed your times reward points. By clicking on them you will open a new page where you get a choice of things to exchange your reward points for. Advanced goods and magic items are available just like skilled units and even knowledgable mages.

<p>However you may get only a maximum number of reward points per turn for each of these possible reward incomes. This should prevent players from overdoing things like posting masses of relatively uninteresting posts to the forum just to get masses of reward points. It also limits the times to being a nice addon instead of the most powerful feature in the game.
