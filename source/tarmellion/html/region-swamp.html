<h3>Swamps of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-swamp.jpg align=right>The swamps of Tarmellion are wet miserable places inhabited by lizardmen and serpent people.
<p>Giant rats, swamp creatures and undead add to the unwholesome feeling of these lands. Hidden in the pathless midst of the swamps ruins, evil mage towers and dark towers as well as the peat bog, the home of the bog thing, can be found.
<p>Surprisingly grain, some sheep and cattle survive on the dryer parts. From time to time stunted trees rise out of the bracken. Most herbs, fungus and medicine plants can only be found in swamps though. There are also many beasts that can be hunted for their meat, their fur or their pelts.
