<h3>Chambers of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-chamber.jpg align=right>The chambers of Tarmellion are smaller than caverns. While the caverns link many acres of relatively flat land together, the chambers are only roomy enough for a city and its surroundings. But often many chambers are grouped around a common center. Darkman, gnomes, dwarves, minotaurs, duergar and drow all like to live here.
<p>Upon entering a chamber one might encounter a fanged lizard, a mauler or a two headed ettin. If extremely unlucky there might also be the lair of a black dragon, a giant castle or a dark tower.
<p>Chambers are famous for their large fields of mushroom, that act as substitude for grain below the earth, their flocks of the wooly meatballs called woolinger and herds of lizards domesticated for their milk, meat and hide. Some farmers even plant a special type of mushroom that comes in different colours. Sometimes some of the treelike mushrooms are found here too. Out of the walls stone, rootstone and maybe even corestone can be quarried. Many strange types of lizard live in chambers. They are hunted because they are a source for meat, fur and even sometimes valuable pelt. Another commodity are the herbs, fungus and maybe even medicine plants that grow in cracks and crannies. The preferred mount of the chambers is the giant lizard, because of its stamina and speed. A close cousin of these mounts is the flying lizard that can be seen - if very lucky - here too.
