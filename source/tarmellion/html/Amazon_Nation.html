<h2>Amazon Nation</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>Xanthara the capital of the Amazons lies in the dark heart of the forest of Surdell on the continent of Ashar. The forest is nested between the rivers Norran and Grantham and consist of about a dozen regions.
<p>Government:
<br>Lady Margaret of Grantham and Finchley rules her realm as if it was an army on the move (which it often is). Her subjects all have a military rank and the nobles are the officers of this army. So far the amazons have been content to raid into their neighbourhood for fun and profit, but it seems that now they plan to expand a bit.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Amazons are very seclusive and other races aren´t seen often in Xanthara with the exception of the ogres who not only share the forests with the amazons but also their love of a good fight. As human males are only fit to produce female offspring other races come mostly only as traders.
