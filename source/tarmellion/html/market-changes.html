<h2>Market Changes</h2>

<p>The city markets have also been reworked. 
<ol>

<li>
<b>Benefit of Trade</b>
<p>Every kind of trade is beneficial for the community. Meaning that regardless if somebody buys from or sells to the city market, the city will grow. 
<br>
</li>
<p>

<li>
<b>Food Markets</b>
<p>Each village, town and city will require large amounts of rations, food, delicatessen, meat and other <a href=item-changes.html>foodstuffs</a>. 
<br>
</li>
<p>

<li>
<b>No Weapons/Armour</b>
<p>City markets will buy and sell no weapons or armour. Only tools might be available in some cases. There are enough things a trader can produce out of each raw material that can be sold without flooding the markets with implements of destruction. Factions wanting to buy these things will either have to produce them themselves or buy them from other players.
