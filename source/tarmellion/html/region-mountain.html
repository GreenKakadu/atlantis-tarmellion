<h3>Mountains of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-mountain.jpg align=right>The mountains of Tarmellion are craggy and high. As the world still is quite young time did not have a chance yet to smooth them down. Clansmen and orcs inhabit their dales and slopes.
<p>Mountain lions, rocs and wild trolls make things interesting, but if someone is particularly unlucky he might stumble upon a cloud palace, an ancient temple or even the lair of a red dragon.
<p>The hardy mountain folk plant small fields of grain and herd a few sheep or some cattle. But mainly they dig out iron, rough gems, the shiny mithril, gold and admantium. They also quarry stone, the more resilient rootstone and the magical corestone. Both giant wolves and giant eagles can be found here and be trained as mounts. On the highest peaks of the nest the proud griffons or the aggressive chimera. Small woods grow on the gentler slopes.
