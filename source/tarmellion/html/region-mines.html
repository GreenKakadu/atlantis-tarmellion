<h3>Mines of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-mines.jpg align=right>The mines of Tarmellion are complicated systems of adits, galleries and shafts that riddle a specific area of a Hollowsphere. Darkman, gnomes, dwarves, minotaurs, duergar and drow all live and work in them.
<p>The mines are the natural hunting ground for fanged lizards, maulers and ettins, but there might also be the lair of a black dragon, a giant castle or a dark tower in one of the roomier areas.
<p>Mines were built to get at the large deposits of iron, rough gems, mithril, admantium and gold that can be found here. By doing that stone, rootstone and sometimes corestone are cut out of the solid walls. But there are also small fields of mushroom, some flocks of the woolingers and herds of lizards to feed the miners. Giant lizards are used as mounts and for transportation.
