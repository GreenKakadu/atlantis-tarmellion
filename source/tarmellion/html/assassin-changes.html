<h2>Assassination Changes</h2>

<p>As the mages are a lot less powerful in Tarmellion their only counterpart - the assassin - has also been changed here. 
<br>I do apologize to all assassin players for not posting this earlier, but if anybody wants to change his signup as assassin because of what I write here, please just contact me with the faction name and the new profession or race/profession you would then like to have.
