<h2>Item Changes</h2>

<p>There are very many new items in Tarmellion and I will not list them all here. Most can be seen on the tables at <a href=things.html target=_top>Game Items</a>.
<br>However there are some new types of items too and I will try to describe them here.

<ol>

<li>
<b>Bondsmen</b>
<p>Two new races have been added. they are available in each starting city and will transform on buying them into the normal unit (for RBOND) or the leader (for LBOND) of the race the buying faction has.
<p>An example: faction 555 has chosen the race imperial at singup. It starts in RAM, the imperial starting city. There the players gives the orders:
<br>FORM 1
<br>BUY 10 RBOND
<br>END
<br>FORM 2
<br>BUY 2 LBOND
<br>END
<br>He will have a new unit with 10 imperials (RIMPE) and another unit with 2 imperial leaders (LIMPE) next turn.
<p>This feature should ensure that everybody gets at least some followers of his own race. They are bit more expensive than the native races though.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Monstermounts</b>
<p>There are items that can be used as mount in combat who also fight for themselves. They are describe in more detail in the <a href=combat-changes.html>combat changes</a>.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Producable Monsters</b>
<p>In addition to monsters that can be summoned by mages, there are now also monsters that can be produced. There are two skills for this. Animal taming and monster taming. Both of them need knowledge of animal training before they can be studied. Monster taming is only available for evil factions and animal taming only for good factions. The producers need a <a href=building-changes.html>specific building</a> to allow them to work.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Tools</b>
<p>Almost all producable items have a tool that helps producing them. Which tool helps and how much bonus it gives is listed with the description of the producable item. A unit knowing the skill necessary to produce a certain item and having the correct tool for it, will gain additional manmonths because of the tool. 
<br>For example a unit of 5 lumberjacks with skill level 2 and 5 axes can produce 5 (men) * 2 (skill level) + 5 (tools) * 2 (tool bonus for wood) = 20 wood. 
<br>The same unit with 6 axes could also produce only 20 wood, as a tool without a skilled wielder is worth nothing.. 
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Producable Magic Items</b>
<p>The magic foundation skills spirit, force and pattern have an additional use in Tarmellion. If they are high enough they enable the unit to produce some magic items without casting a spell. These magic items need special raw materials that normally are gained by killing monsters. 
<br>For example: A faction has slain an evil wyrm and gotten dragonblood as part of the spoils (In fact it probably spilled all over them). They carry this to their mage back home, who has perfected his pattern skill by casting earth lore. He now only needs a bit of high quality cashmere, the right surroundings and a bit of time and a high class magical item is made. 
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Monster Drop Items</b>
<p>As already mentioned above there are special items that can only be gained by slaying the correct monster. These items are needed to produce the producable magic items.
<br>
</li>
 
<li>
<b>Foodstuff</b>
<p>In Tarmellion one of most important tasks for aleader will be to get his subjects fed. 
<br>One way of getting this done is by providing enough money for them to buy food (the standard 10 silver upkeep). 
<br>A more efficient way is to produce raw foodstuffs like grain. And then produce rations or food out of them. As each step of production will effectively multiply the number of men that can be fed with the output, this allows to feed more men than could be supplied with only the tax income of a region. 
<br>An example hex with 2000 silver tax income could supply units up to 200 men. 
<br>If this hex has a supply of 25 grain, sufficient farmers and cooks could feed at least 100 men with rations made out fo this grain.
<br>If there are also 25 sheep available in that hex. Ranchers could give them to the butchers (also ranching needed) who produce 50 meat out of them. The cooks could then make them into 200 rations.
<br>
</li>
<p>

<li>
<b>Trade Goods</b>
<p>Trade goods are something different in Tarmellion. There are no more the items that can only be bought and sold. Each thing in Tarmellion is producable (or castable) somehow safe people. If trade goods are mentioned then all things that can be bought and sold at city markets are meant except the people that are for hire there. 
<br>
</li>
<p>



</ol>

<p>Well I hope I got them all. If not you will find out in the game.
