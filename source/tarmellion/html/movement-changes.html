<h2>Movement Changes</h2>

<p>There have been some small, but far-reaching modifications done to movement.

<ol>

<li>
<b>Ship Speed</b>
<p>Each ship type has its own speed. The exact values for each ship can be seen <a href=ships.html>here</a>.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Sailable land</b>
<p>The terrain called lake is primarily land, but it can be sailed by ships as if it was ocean.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Modified Summon Wind spell</b>
<p>The Summon Wind spell now adds a bonus to sailing and flying speed equal to its skill level independant of the ship type used.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Tunnels</b>
<p>There is an underground terrain type called tunnels that has comes in three different types, that the player cannot tell apart. They look the same, but one type needs 1 movement point, the other two movement points and the last three movement points. This terrain feature was added to compensate for the lack of bad weather underground. Together with the walls (unavailable movement directions) this should balance underground and surface.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Unsailable land</b>
<p>The terrain called volcano cannot be entered by ship.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Complete list of required movement points for each terrain</b>
<p>On the surface winter or monsoon halfs the movement points of a unit.
<br>Roads half the listed required movement points of terrain with at least 2 MP.
