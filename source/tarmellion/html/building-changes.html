<h2>Building Changes</h2>

<p>There are several new types of buildings available in Tarmellion.

<ol>

<li>
<b>Second Trade Structures</b>
<p>Besides the known trade structures that boost a certain resource by 25% (decreasing by half for each built building), there now is another trade structures that adds a fixed bonus to a certain resource available in a hex. This bonzus is also halfed for each additional building of that type in a hex. Which trade structure is needed for which resource can be seen on this <a href=ressources.html>table</a>.  
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Production Buildings</b>
<p>A third type of trade structures are the production buildings, that are required if a certain product or resource is to be produced at all. The producers have to be inside the building before their produce orders will work. For advanced weapons and armour a smithy is needed. The other obligatory production buildings can be seen on this <a href=ressources.html>table</a>.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Population effect of buildings</b>
<p>>Most buildings in Tarmellion have an effect on the maximum population of the hex they are in. The exact bonus can be seen in this <a href=buildings.html>table</a>. This effect is halfed for each additional building in this hex of the same type.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Maximum Wage effect of buildings</b>
<p>Some buildings increase the amount of labour in the hex they are in. The maximum wares in the hex is increased. But this effect is halfed for each subsequent building of the same type. The exact values can be seen <a href=buildings.html>here</a>.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Construction tools</b>
<p>Tools are now available that aid in the construction of structures. A tool adds one or two manmonths of labour to the workforce building the structure. Naturally a tools will only have an effect if some with the correct skill uses it. Which tools help for which structure and by how much can be seen <a href=buildings.html>here for buildings</a> and <a href=ships.html>here for ships</a>.
