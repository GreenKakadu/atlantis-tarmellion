<h3>Caverns of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-cavern.jpg align=right>The caverns of Tarmellion are very large "caves" in the Hollowspheres of Tarmellion. They are inhabited by darkmen, dwarves, duergar and minotaurs.  
<p>But there are also other inhabitants like the fanged lizard, the mauler or some ettins with their two heads. Sometimes you can see a dark tower, a giants castle or even the lair of a black dragon, the bane of the Hollowsphere.
<p>In caverns may be found large fields of mushroom, that act as substitude for grain below the earth, flocks of the wooly meatballs called woolinger and herds of lizards domesticated for their milk, meat and hide. From time to time there are even fields of tasty truffles. Out of the walls of these caverns stone, rootstone and maybe even corestone can be quarried. Iron, mithril, admantium and gold lodes paint red, shiny silver, blueblack and yellow stripes on the walls and ceiling and rough gems sprinkle small pinpoints of light on the walls. Sometimes some kinds of lizards run free in these caverns and are hunted for their meat. Giant lizards thirve here too and are trained as mounts. From time to time a cavern houses giant centipedes or drakes that make formidable battle beasts if trained correctly.
