<h2>Dwarven Kingdom</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>This Kingdom lies below the earth in the Hollowsphere called underworld. A huge cavern of two dozen fertile and rich grottoes makes this kingdom into one of the largest realms of Tarmellion. 
<p>Government:
<br>Balin Stronginthearm the dwarven king rules in Minehome the large city in the centre of the kingdom cavern. The correct title is Thane of Thanes as he is the chief of the dwarven clan chiefs which are called thanes. Balin has a bit of trouble holding his lands together. On the one hand there are evil monsters that test the strength of the Deepenguards continually and on the other hand there are the dwarevn chiefs themselves who can be as hard-headed as the stone they quarry. Help in stabilizing the realm is certainly welcome.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Apart from exploring the mysterious tunnels and shafts of the underworld, fighting monsters at almost every step, undreamed of riches can be found below the earth that only wait for the pick of an determined merchant or artificer.
