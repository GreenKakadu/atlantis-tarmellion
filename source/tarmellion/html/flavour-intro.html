<h2>Welcome to the World of Tarmellion</h2>
<p>Tarmellion is a very young world with large craggy mountains, deep seas and endless forests. In astronomical terms its bedrock ain´t hardly dry. There are three large continents called Ashar, Avlon and Ardan and numerous islands on the surface of Tarmellion. Four huge oceans: the Western Sea, the Eastern Sea, the Mare Delphinae und the Mare Levanticus; and three smaller seas: the Zudwater, the Ice Sea and the Silent Sea add up to seven seas on Tarmellion. Below the surface there are two large complexes of caverns, grottoes, mines, tunnels and so on that intercept each other. These complexes are called Hollowspheres and are named underworld and underdeeps. 
<p>Consequently to its youth civilization on Tarmellion is also very young. The majority of Tarmellion lives in smallish communities or even anarchy. Only a few realms have evolved so far and they are a magnet for the gifted and adventurous from all around. 12 big cities have grown out of their humble village origins, but things have only just started.
