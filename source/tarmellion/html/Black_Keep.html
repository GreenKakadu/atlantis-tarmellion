<h2>Black Keep</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>The Black Keep and its surrounding city lie on the shore of an icy lake that spills into the Black River. Eastwardly stretch the fertile plains of Esgaroth with their multitudes of loyal subjects. 
<p>Government:
<br>Their loyality is ensured by the strong arms of the Ironsides, the feared Black Keep Infantry of Lord Protector Crymwell who rules his realm with an iron fist and a shrewd mind. World domination is a foregon conclusion for him and anyway the hunger of Ardvark has to be stilled somehow. 
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Gifted nobles, brilliant officers and brave warriors are always welcome to swell the ranks of the Army and to conquer everything that there is. But Ardvark has another way of getting his share, the assassins trained in his temple are feared even in the command tents of the most successful generals.
