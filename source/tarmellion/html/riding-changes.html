<h2>Riding Changes</h2>

<p>The way mounts are used has been modified in Tarmellion.
<ol>

<li>
<b>Mounts have hits</b>
<p>A skilled rider (having at least riding 1) may survive an attack, because his mount gets hit instead of himself. A 50% chance is checked if the rider is hit, if his mount gets killed instead.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Monstermounts</b>
<p>Creatures with their own combat statistics can also give a bonus to their riders combat skill. On top of their own combat statistics, they will add the riders riding skill to his combat skill.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Riding works the same regardless of the terrain</b>
<p>The bonus of the riding skill to the combat skill of the rider is only dependant on the riding skill level of the rider and the requirements and limits of the mount not the terrain they are in.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Modified the riding bonuses and requirements of all mounts</b>
<p>Each mount has a certain minimum skill level of riding it needs to be ridden effectively in combat. In short if the rider does not have enough riding skill, he will get no bonus to his combat skill.
<br>There is a maximum limit of the bonus a certain mount can generate for its rider. A small non-aggressive mount like a pony will not boost its riders combat strength like an impressive and/or trained mount like a war elephant.
<br>Here is a short table with all skill requirements and limits of all mounts:
