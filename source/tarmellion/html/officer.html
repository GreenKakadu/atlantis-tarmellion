<h2>Officer</h2>
<p>A soldier from head to toe, the officer is the fundamental man-at-arms. Every nation of Tarmellion wants to have one of these gifted individuals in their pay to train their soldiers and then lead them to victory after victory.
<br>His knowledge about all fighting styles and his strategic capabilities are exceptional.
<br>Alas many officers use their power to carve their own realms out of the wilderness or even usurp the thrones of weaker rulers.
