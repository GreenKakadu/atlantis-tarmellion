<h2>Seaman</h2>
<p>Home to the seas, the seaman is the master of his ship and the waves. Sailing on the seas of Tarmellion, he is the master of this wet domain.
<br>He can feed his crew from the bounty of the sea, sail and build the mighiest vessels and also knows how to defend his crew and ship remarkably well.
<br>Seamen often have their own small retreats where they can outfit or build their ships and whereto they return after a profitable trade or looting venture.
