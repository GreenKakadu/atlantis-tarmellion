<h3>Grottoes of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-grotto.jpg align=right>The grottoes of Tarmellion are very scarce. Smaller than caverns they are normally only roomy enough for a city and its surroundings. An abundant supply of water has not only formed stalagtites and stalagmites but also ensures rich vegetation. Darkman, gnomes, dwarves, minotaurs, duergar and drow all like to live here.
<p>The wealth of a grotto attracts demons, undead and evil warriors and there might also be the lair of a black dragon, a giant castle, a dark tower, the lair of the mindeating illyrthil or a simple cave with lots of bones out front.
<p>Grottoes are the richest type of terrain in the Hollowspheres. They have very large fields of mushroom, that act as substitude for grain below the earth, numerous flocks of the wooly meatballs called woolinger and large herds of lizards domesticated for their milk, meat and hide. There also are special plants that comes in different colours. Sometimes some of the treelike mushrooms are found here too. Out of the walls stone, rootstone and maybe even corestone can be quarried. Iron, mithril, admantium and gold lodes paint red, shiny silver, blueblack and yellow stripes on the walls and ceiling and rough gems sprinkle small pinpoints of light on the walls. There are the herbs, fungus and maybe even medicine plants that grow in cracks and crannies. Giant spiders and giant bats inhabit these grottoes as well as the rarer flying lizard. In some of them fire lizards or fire drakes have roosted.
