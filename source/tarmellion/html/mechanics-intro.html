<h2>Mechanics of the game of Tarmellion</h2>
<p>Tarmellion is an open-ended computer moderated fantasy game for any   number of players. Players may attempt to carve out huge empires, become master magicians, intrepid explorers, rich traders or any other career that comes to mind. There is no declared winner of the game; players set their own objectives, and one can join at any time.
<p>It is based on the play-by-email game of atlantis, but was heavily modified to suit the gamemasters idea of an email roleplaying game.
<p>The standard atlantis ruleset although still valid in most places has been modified in others. These pages should give all information to allow someone who knows the standard ruleset to play tarmellion. People unfamiliar with the atlantis game should perhaps read the outdated ruleset first and then delve into the added information of this homepage. But probably playing the game is enough to get to know it as all information needed is provided with the reports. A complete listing and explanation of all possible orders (commands given by email to the persons peopling Tarmellion) is available here.
<p>The game can either be played by using the standard email technique or by using the web interfaces available on these pages like the "order form" to submit new orders or the "report download form" to get the current report of what your people did last month.
<p>Each player may have only one faction (the total of the ingame people handled by a player). Playing multiple factions is considered cheating and will be punished by deletion of ALL factions of this player. Sitting an account (playing another faction during an absence of a fellow player e.g. because of holidays) is allowed, but should be announced to the game master. Everybody who fears that his faction could be accidently mistaken for a part of multiple factions should inform the game master too. There are many valid reasons for two factions being played from the same internet access for example. 
<p>There is a forum for the game where questions about the game can be posted and will be answered by the game master and experienced players. So if you have any problems with the workings of the game or need help in formulating a successful strategy, please check out <a href=http://www.herobane.de/forum>Tarmellion Forum</a>.
<p>Helpful for the generation of your orders and to keep an overview of your lands are the so called atlantis clients - graphical tools that allow you to load your reports into them and create your orders using a graphical interface. There are two that I can recommend:
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.geocities.com/pbemah/>Atlantis Little Helper</a> - A standard atlantis client that is resilient enough to take on Tarmellion reports even though they mangled the atlantis code quite a bit. It is very dependable and is easy to use.
<li><a href=http://gnawer.byte-force.yar.ru/advisor/index.html>Atlantis Advisor</a> - A powerful tool to do your full turn using only mouse clicks. There is a customization available for Tarmellion-type games that may not be fully up to date as the code just got finished. Just check out its homepage for more information.
</ul>
<p>Turns will be run on Thursdays. The order deadline is 12:00 o`clock (noon) and the turn will be run between 12:00 and 20:00 o`clock depending on my personal timetable. The timezone is GMT + 1 (Greenwich Mean Time plus 1 hour). There will be one turn a week, so there should be enough time to fully roleplay ones faction.
