<h3>Volcanoes of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-volcano.jpg align=right>The volcanoes of Tarmellion are fiery places and completely inhabitable. 
<p>Skeletons, imps and evil warriors lurk there and bide their time until they can invade other places. Cloud palaces, demon pits and the lairs of evil red dragons spawn their murderous denizens.
<p>But the volcanoes also yield riches to those brave enough to get them. Iron, rough gems, mithril, gold and admantium can be found here. Also stone, rootstone and corestone is available. The giant eagles prefer the desolate peaks of the mountains surrounding volcanoes as nesting places. In these areas the fabled fire lizards or fire drake can also be found.
