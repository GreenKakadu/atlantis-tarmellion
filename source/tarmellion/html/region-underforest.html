<h3>Underforests of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-underforest.jpg align=right>The underforests of Tarmellion are caverns on whose floor large woody mushrooms grow. Darkman, gnomes, minotaurs and drow prefer to live here.
<p>Walking beneath the caps of these mushrooms one might stumble upon a poison spider, a bugbear or a renegade drow warrior. If extremely unlucky it might also be the lair of the mindeating illyrthil, a necromancers guild, a magetower or a simple cave with lots of bones out front.
<p>Sustenance provide the fields of mushroom, that act as substitude for grain below the earth, flocks of the wooly meatballs called woolinger and herds of lizards domesticated for their milk, meat and hide. Some farmers even breed the poisonous spiders, so that they can press their poison out of them when they are ripe. The mushrooms of the underforests are the primary source of wood, a thing similar to ironwood and if lucky something like yew for the inhabitans of the Hollowspheres. Out of the walls stone, rootstone and maybe even corestone can be quarried. Sometimes some kinds of lizards that run free here are hunted for their meat. Another chief commodity are the herbs, fungus and maybe even medicine plants that grow amidst the tree mushrooms. The preferred mount of the underforests is the giant spider, that can climb over or around every obstacle. From time to time giant centipedes or drakes live here too.
