<h2>Ramish Empire</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>Ram, the capital city, is built on the shores of some lakes that are fed from the river Tybar. It is the largest city on the continent Avlon. The successful Empire spans already more than a dozen provinces consisting mainly of heavilyx populated and fertile plains.
<p>Government:
<br>The Ramish Empire is the greatest seat of civilization on the continent Avlon. Emperor Titus Andronicus rules this thriving land and his legions will see to it that this lasts. The Emperor tries to enlarge his realm and is willing to cooperate with successful young heroes who want to help him with this noble undertaking.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Adventurers from all directions come to Ram, but mostly nobles trying to get titles from the Emperor, officers vying for a command in the Imperial Legions, warriors out to make a name for themselves or the assassins of the Imperial College of Inhumation can be found next to the native Imperials.
