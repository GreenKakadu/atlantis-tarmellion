<h3>Plains of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-plain.jpg align=right>The plains of Tarmellion are fertile and heavily populated. Especially imperials, halfings, black keep followers and republicans have settled them. 
<p>But there are dangers too. Flocks of wild crow, bands of wildmen or thiefs plaque the peasants. Sometimes a ruin, a crypt, a forbidding castle or the lair of a blue dragon promises even greater evils.
<p>Rich fields of grain, cotton and sometimes even tobacco are the prime resource of these areas. White dots from the numerous flocks of sheep or from time to time the larger bodies of cows stand out from the fresh green of its meadows. It is rumored that even the elusive pointy eared sheep can be found here. Small herds of horses or sometimes ponies add their own charm. If you are really lucky, you may even see one of the elusive winged horses. Here and there smalls copes of wood disturb the flat character of this terrain.
