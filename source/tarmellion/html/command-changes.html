<h2>Command Changes</h2>

<p>There are two new orders for your units available in Tarmellion.

<ol>

<li>
<b>idle command</b>
<p>Idle allows units to do nothing for one month, thus preventing units from "stealing" work income from their hosts or getting error messages in hexes without work income.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>settle command</b>
<p>Changes evil race population into good race population and vice versa. Can only be used by good factions on evil race populations and the other way round. You have to have at least 10 percent of the population as soldiers to use this command. Guarding a hex will prevent settling. This is a monthlong order. 
<br>
</li>
