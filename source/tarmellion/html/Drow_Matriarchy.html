<h2>Drow Matriarchy</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>Parth'Tir'Dallon the capital city of the drow is the centre of the huge underground cavern of Seindelamere. Which lies in the Holloowsphere called underdeeps and consist of about two dozen regions of prime grotto stock.
<p>Government:
<br>The drow are ruled by the Matrons of the great houses who not only are rulers but priestesses of Lucyfear. The house Do'Paraden currently holds the most favour with Lucyfear and consequently Yallmara Do'Paraden is High Priestess and rules all drow.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>As drow think of everybody else as inferior things could be described as tense, but as they need experts and fighters as much as everyone else things aren´t as bad as they sound. Other races won´t be able to reach high station or even command positions, but perhaps one may leave the territory controlled by the drow and start fresh on ones own.
