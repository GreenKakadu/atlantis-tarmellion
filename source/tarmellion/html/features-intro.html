<h2>New Features of the game of Tarmellion</h2>
<p>Many things were changed in Tarmellion from the way atlantis engines usually worked. Most of them are not part of the outdated rules available on this homepage. If you want to find out what has changed from the game you knew or had just learned by studying the rules here, just read these pages.
<p>I will add all features in the near future, hopefully before the game starts.
<p>If you do not find something, please take a look at the <a href=http://www.herobane.de/forum>forum</a>
