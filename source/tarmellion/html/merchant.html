<h2>Merchant</h2>
<p>Merchants are the backbone of every nations economy. They have unrivalled knowledge about all kinds of ressources. 
<br>They can outbargain even the stubbornest dwarven miner and their sales strategies are legendary: "It’s a bargain: one for 30 silver and three for 100 silver."
