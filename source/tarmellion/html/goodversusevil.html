<h2>GOOD versus EVIL</h2>

<p>The distinction between good and evil has been incorporated into the game engine in Tarmellion. A player, faction and his primary race are either good or evil. This has some effects on the gameplay:

<ol>

<li>
<b>buying</b>
<p>good faction cannot buy evil races and vice versa.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>settle command</b>
<p>good factions can settle hexes with evil race population into corresponding good population and vice versa.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>starting location</b>
<p>good factions start in a specific area of the world and evil ones in another.
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>monsters</b>
<p>There are monsters that are only producable/summonable by good factions:
<br>hunting dog, charger, battlelizard, unicorn, drake, griffon, behemoth, war elephant, fire drake, all dragons
<p>And some only by evil factions:
<br>war dog, warhorse, warlizard, harpy, giant cenitpede, chimera, walking fortress, war mammoth, fire lizard, all wyrms
<br>
</li>

<p>
<li>
<b>roleplaying</b>
<p>Naturally the decision between good and evil will have effects on the roleplaying of the characters and factions, but the game engine will not enforce these effects as they are not seizable enough for this. 
<br>A good faction may have peaceful contact with an evil faction and at the same time wage war against another good faction. If there is sufficient reason for this in the roleplaying history of these factions, everything is all right. 
<br>But if someone just wants to disregard all conventions of roleplaying and acts against fundamental guidelines he will be punished with loss of times reward points and like things.
