<h3>Lakes of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-lake.jpg align=right>The lakes of Tarmellion are plains with numerous small lakes. They are even more fertile than normal plains. Imperials, halfings, black keep followers and republicans have settled them. 
<p>The same dangers can be found here too. Flocks of wild crow, bands of wildmen or thiefs plaque the peasants. Sometimes a ruin, a crypt, a forbidding castle or the lair of a blue dragon promises even greater evils.
<p>Rich fields of grain, cotton and sometimes even tobacco are the prime resource of these areas. White dots from the numerous flocks of sheep or from time to time the larger bodies of cows stand out from the fresh green of its meadows. It is rumored that even the elusive points eared sheep can be found here. Small herds of horses or sometimes ponies add their own charm. The elusive winged horses are more numerous around bodies of water like the lakes. Here and there smalls copes of wood disturb the flat character of this terrain. Naturally fish can be found in the lakes themselves.
