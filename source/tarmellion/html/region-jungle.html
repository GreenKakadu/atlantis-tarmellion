<h3>Jungles of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-jungle.jpg align=right>The jungles of Tarmellion are inmhabited by tribes man or headhunters. 
<p>The dangers of the jungle are the snakes, tigers and wild ogres that live here. In ruins, dark towers and magetowers more sinister evil lurks, but the greatest danger of the jungle lies in the deepest thicket where the hydra lives.
<p>Apart from some grain growing wild, small flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, the forests are known for their abundancy healing herbs, fungus and medicine plants. Naturally the big tress also yield wood, the tougher ironwood and the yew that is rumored to have magical properties. But game can also be found here. Both the normal kind that provides fresh meat to the hunter and the kind that is hunted for its fur or even valuable pelt. Sometimes small outcrops of rock marr the green carpet of the jungle. The largest inhabitant of the jungle is the elephant that is used as a mount by the people living here.
