<h2>Noble</h2>
<p>Nobles are the born rulers of Tarmellion. Their extensive knowledge about agriculture, infrastructure and even military allows them to build thriving realms out of the wilderness.
<br>Each large and thriving nation will probably be headed by a noble, whose high birth and good education elevate him over the unblessed masses.
