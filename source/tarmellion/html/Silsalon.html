<h2>Silsalon</h2>
<p>Geography:
<br>Silsalon the capital city of the Elves lies in the deepest part of the Elven Woods near the river Silverwater on the continent Ardan. The forest is quite large, you would need about 4 days to traverse it in each direction, and full of wonders like the treetop houses of the Elves or the shy unicorns of.
<p>Government:
<br>The Imperial Family Emperor Silgorthas, Empress Siliana, Prince Silrogas and Princess Alirasil rule the Elven People since the dawn of time. They have been content to stay in their blessed forest so far but they will react to anyone who wants to threaten peace.
<p>Opportunities:
<br>Mystics and Magicusers from all over Ardan and Avlon come to Silsalon to study the magic arts perfected here. As the Elven people are seclusive other visitors are sparse, but sometimes traders from nearby lands can be seen walking under the green dome of the trees of Silsalon.
