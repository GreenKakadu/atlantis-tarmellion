<h3>The mysterious forests of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-mystforest.jpg align=right>The mysterious forests of Tarmellion lie at the heart of the largest forests. Elves, ffolk, amazons and ogres inhabit them. 
<p>But wolfs, nasty living trees and mischevious kobolds live here too and they are always eager for a fight. If you stumble upon an ancient temple or some other ruin, a dark temple or the tower of a dark mage even greater peril awaits you, but the most unfortunate thing to find is the lair of a green dragon.
<p>Apart from some grain growing wild, small flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, the forests are known for their nearly endless supply of wood, the tougher ironwood and the yew that is rumored to have magical properties. But game can also be found here. Both the normal kind that provides fresh meat to the hunter and the kind that is hunted for its fur or even valuable pelt. In the undergrowth herbs, fungus and medicine plants with healing abliites may be found. Sometimes one can see some woodland ponies or giant wolves that are trained by the inhabitants as mounts. The most hidden inhabitants of the forest are the unicorn and the harpy. They live in the deepest parts of the wood and will show themselves only scarcely. Sometimes small outcrops of rock marr the green carpet of the forest.
