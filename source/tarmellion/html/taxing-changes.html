<h2>Taxing Changes</h2>

<p>Taxing is a topic I had nearly overlooked here. It wasn´t really changed, but reorganized for Tarmellion. From the possibilities the standard game engine offers the following choices have been made:
<ol>

<li>
<b>Combat Skill</b>
<p>Everybody who knows how to fight may also tax.
<br></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Archery and Crossbow Skills</b>
<p>Also those that know how to fight with ranged weapons can tax.
<bR></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Riding Skill</b>
<p>Knowing how to use a mount in combat is impressive enough to tax too.
<bR></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Magic Skills</b>
<p>Being a mage will get a peasant to pay taxes. 
<br></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Ownership of weapons</b>
<p>A peasant asked to pay taxes will not demand to see if the tax collector can really use his weapons.
<br></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Ownership of magic battle items</b>
<p>Having a staff known to bring death should be enough to cow a peasant into paying taxes.
<br></li>

<p>
<li>
<b>Ownership of monsters</b>
<p>Riding a dragon or a war mammoth is another sure way to get the tax payer to cooperate.
<br></li>
