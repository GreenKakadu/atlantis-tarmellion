<h2>Mage</h2>
<p>Mages are the masters of magic. Although magic abilities are widespread in Tarmellion and most members of some races have the sparkle of magic in them, they are the only ones who can truly achieve mastery in this art.
<br>The storms of energy or the powerful strike of their minds will send many enemies into oblivion. Their summoned allies, be they noble dragons or vile balrogs, will plant fear into the hearts of their oponents. But they can also craft the most powerful artifacts.
<br>Alas as magic study is immensly expensive, they will need a well-funded place to study their art. Although most nations will be delighted to have such a powerful asset in their midst, they need countless laborers to earn enough silver to pay for the magic studies of only one man.
