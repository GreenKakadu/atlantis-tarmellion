<h3>Hills of Tarmellion</h3>

<p><img src=images/region-hill.jpg align=right>The hills of Tarmellion offer a home for barbarians, halfings, gnolls and republicans. 
<p>Wolves, grizzly bears and belligerent tribes of goblins also inhabit them. Ruins, crypts, evil mage towers and the lairs of brown dragons dot the landscape and make life more interesting.
<p>Hills are wine and sheep country. Next to moderate fields of grain, large herds of sheep and sometimes even pointy eared sheep can be seen. Some cattle graze the gentler slopes and built on terraces on the southern slopes vineyards yield the grapes needed to produce wine. Some of the hills are wooded, some hide small deposits of iron, rough gems, mithril, gold or admantium. The rockier ones can be quarried for stone, rootstone and sometimes even corestone. Even hunters sometimes can find a bit of game worth hunting. Ponies and giant wolves are the preferred mounts and a special breed of dogs is raised here to defend the herds from wild wolves - called war dogs or hunting dogs.
